# plotlyGiniGDPchart
The following repo contains a set files used to generated a time series chart for the GDP/Gini coefficient.

## plot_gini_gdp.R
The file contains the principal syntax needed to generate the chart.

## helper.R
The file contains some syntax that I drafted when playing with the plot, like getting list of tables available via the `SmarterPoland` package. The file is not required to run the plot but you may find it useful.
